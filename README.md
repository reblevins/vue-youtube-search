# vue-youtube-search

This app was created using the `npm create vue@latest` command which generates a Vue 3/Vite boilerplate app.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

Rename the file in the root of the project called `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` in the root of the project and replace `replace_with_api_key` with the api key I gave you.

## Usage

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now you can navigate to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) and once there, you will need to log in using the Google-generated login button.
